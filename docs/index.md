## Beacon Brief

Every Monday. The week's Beacon changes, in plain English.

<!-- BEACON_BRIEF_START -->

### Week of 20–26 Apr 2026

This was a solid week of consolidation and expansion. AI Receptionists got a full navigation home view added to the sidebar, which means designers can now prototype the complete receptionist experience end-to-end. The bigger move was collapsing all the AI Assistant feature flags into devtools so you're not hunting across five different panels to toggle things. Canvas conversations now talk directly to Dialpad services through new hooks, the callbar picked up campaign context, and the layout engine got smarter about reclaiming space when you close panels. These are the kinds of changes that make prototyping feel less janky.

#### What actually changed

**AI Receptionists navigation and home view** — Added AgentsLeftSidebar and ReceptionistNavPanel so you can build full receptionist flows with a dedicated home view and detail pages. New useReceptionists hooks support the whole thing.

**AI Assistant feature flags consolidated** — All the toggles for AI-assisted design features now live in a single devtools panel instead of scattered across the app.

**Canvas AI conversations integrated with Dialpad** — useCanvasConversations, useDialpadConversation, and useDialpadPanel hooks let the canvas talk to Dialpad services for real conversation management in the left sidebar and content area.

**Power Dialer campaign context in callbar** — The callbar now shows which campaign an active call belongs to without you having to leave the calling interface.

**Inbox using conversation index pipeline** — The entire Inbox section (detail feed, message list, data hooks) refactored to use the conversation index pipeline for better performance and filtering.

**Preferences and segmented controls moved to Dialtone** — The Preferences modal and segmented controls got refactored to use Dialtone primitives, so appearance settings and theme selection look and behave more consistently.

**Layout space redistribution when right panel collapses** — The feed area no longer leaves dead space when you close the right panel. Available space gets properly redistributed.

**Star icon removed from channel sidebar groups** — Fixed visual noise where favorites stars were showing up next to channels in system sidebar groups. Only individual contacts and conversations should have favorite status.

#### The bigger shift

There's a clear move toward making Beacon itself feel less like a prototyping tool and more like a real application. Adding campaign context to calls, integrating conversations with Dialpad services, and giving receptionist workflows their own navigation suggests the team is building out proper feature verticals instead of just generic UI components. The consolidation of feature flags and the Dialtone migration also signal a focus on making the tool more predictable and less scattered.

#### Where things are still messy

Canvas AI conversations are new enough that integrations may have rough edges. Reach out to Josh if you hit behavioral changes in the Preferences modal or segmented controls after the Dialtone migration.

#### What's coming next

Expect more feature-specific navigation scaffolds like the Contact Center structure that shipped earlier in April. The pattern of moving from generic hooks to domain-specific ones (receptionist, campaign, conversation) is going to keep going.

#### Try this

Go into devtools and toggle the AI Assistant feature flags. They're all in one panel now instead of spread out. If you're testing AI-assisted design, you'll notice it's much faster to flip things on and off for quick iteration.

#### Quick notes

- Power Dialer campaign context is live in the callbar — test it with active calls to see which campaign they belong to.
- Inbox is now using the conversation index pipeline for better data handling — if you notice changes in how messages load or filter, that's why.
- The callbar, inbox feed, and preferences modal all saw real improvements this week. None of these are breaking, but they're worth a quick look if you're working in those areas.

#### One thing to remember

Beacon is getting faster and more predictable. The infrastructure work around conversation pipelines and feature flags consolidation is boring but it means your prototypes will behave more like the real product.

### Week of 13–19 Apr 2026

AI features got more organized this week, and the inbox got a real upgrade under the hood. Josh consolidated all the AI Assistant feature flags into one devtools panel, which means you're not hunting through settings anymore when you want to test different AI behavior. The bigger move was connecting canvas conversations directly to Dialpad's AI service — conversations now persist and you can interact with them right in your workspace. Meanwhile, the inbox switched to a new conversation index pipeline for how it retrieves and filters messages, which should make pagination and loading feel snappier. There's also new stuff for Contact Center navigation in the sidebar, Power Dialer campaign context in the call bar, and a few fixes that clean up visual clutter and interaction bugs.

#### What actually changed

- **AI Assistant feature flags in devtools**: All the toggle controls for AI behavior are now in one panel instead of scattered everywhere.
- **Canvas AI conversation integration**: Conversations now connect to Dialpad's service with persistence and panel management. Check out the new hooks if you're surfacing AI insights in your designs.
- **Inbox conversation index pipeline**: InboxList, InboxDetailFeed, and InboxMessageDetails now use a unified pipeline for retrieving and filtering messages.
- **Power Dialer campaign context in callbar**: ActiveCallOverlay and CallbarOverlays now display which campaign a call belongs to.
- **Contact Center sidebar navigation**: New CcList and CcListRow components let designers preview Contact Center organization in the left sidebar.
- **AI summary pill enhancements**: SummarizePill now has animated state transitions and a share action.
- **Inbox thread display fixes**: Reply indicators now show correctly and thread panels open when you click them.
- **Removed star icon from system sidebar channel groups**: Just a visual cleanup in the left sidebar.

#### The bigger shift

There's a clear momentum toward making AI features more discoverable and usable in the canvas. Feature flags are getting consolidated, conversations are persisting, and new components are shipping to surface AI insights directly in your work. At the same time, inbox and sidebar navigation are getting rebuilt with better data pipelines and scaffolding for larger feature sets like Contact Center.

#### Where things are still messy

The Contact Center sidebar navigation is a scaffold right now, so some behavior depends on feature flags. Josh has notes on that if you need them. The inbox refactor is solid, but if you notice any weird message loading or pagination, that's worth reporting.

#### What's coming next

Contact Center views will probably keep expanding beyond the sidebar navigation. The billing redesign that shipped last week suggests more of the UI is being rebuilt for consistency. Expect more conversation-based features to land in the canvas as the AI integration deepens.

#### Try this

Open devtools in Beacon and find the consolidated AI Assistant feature flag panel. Toggle a few settings and watch how the canvas AI conversation behavior changes. It's much faster than clicking through menus now.

#### Quick notes

- v2026.4.40 landed on the 16th and is the most recent stable release.
- If you're designing around inbox threads, test the new reply indicators — they work now.
- Reach out to Josh if you're exploring Contact Center sidebar behavior or the new billing component APIs.

#### One thing to remember

Feature flags, conversations, and inbox data are all getting unified pipelines this month — designs that rely on these should feel faster and more reliable.

### Week of 6–12 Apr 2026

Josh shipped three releases this week, and they're all about getting you more space and better context while you work. The callbar now shows which Power Dialer campaign a call belongs to, so you don't have to hunt through panels to figure out what you're looking at. The feed area expands when you collapse the right panel, giving you breathing room to actually see your designs. And we fixed a bug where star icons were showing up next to channels they shouldn't have been. None of these are earth-shattering, but together they make Beacon feel a bit less cluttered and a bit more aware of what you're trying to do.

#### What actually changed

Power Dialer campaign context displays in the callbar. Calls now show which campaign they belong to without requiring you to open other panels.

The feed area now expands to fill available horizontal space when you collapse the right panel. You get actual room to work instead of a cramped center column.

Fixed star icons appearing next to channels in system sidebar groups. Only favorited items should show the star now.

#### The bigger shift

The pattern here is removing friction between you and your work. Less clicking to find context. More space to see what you're designing. Fewer visual false positives that make you second-guess what you're seeing.

#### Where things are still messy

Nothing reported as actively broken this week. The docs site had a fix for heading navigation that was causing false skips, but that's backend stuff.

#### What's coming next

Probably more panel and layout refinements. The expansion of the feed area suggests Josh is thinking about how designers actually use the workspace and where their attention needs to go.

#### Try this

Collapse your right panel right now and watch the feed expand. If you're working on anything with a lot of detail, you'll probably notice the difference immediately. It's a small thing that makes a real difference when you're trying to see the whole picture.

#### Quick notes

- v2026.4.35 ships campaign context in callbar
- v2026.4.29 fixes feed area expansion on right panel collapse
- v2026.4.28 removes incorrect star icons from channel lists

#### One thing to remember

Less hunting for context means more time actually designing.
